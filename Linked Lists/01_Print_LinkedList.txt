Print Linked List
Easy
30 / 30
Given a Linked List, print all its nodes.

Example
List: 1→3→4→7
Print: 1 3 4 7
Note: Each node should be separated by a space. Do not print new line anywhere. The main function will add the new line between tests.

Testing
Input Format
The first line contains ‘T’ denoting the number of independent test cases.

For each test case the input has two lines:

A number ‘n’, denoting the length of the linked list.
n space-separated integers denoting elements of the linked list.
Output Format
For each test case, the output has one line with space-separated integers.

Sample Input
2
4
1 3 4 7
3
4 5 6
Expected Output
1 3 4 7
4 5 6
Constraints
1 <= T <= 100

1 <= n <= 1000

1 <= element <= 1000


Solution: 

"""
This is the ListNode class definition

class ListNode:
	def __init__(self, data=0, next=None):
		self.data = data
		self.next = next

"""


class Solution:
	def printLinkedList(self, head: ListNode) -> None:
		# add your logic here

		while head:
			print(head.data, end = ' ')
			head = head.next
