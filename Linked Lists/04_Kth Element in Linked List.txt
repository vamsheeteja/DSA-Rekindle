Easy
30 / 30
Given a Linked List, find the element at the kth position.

Example
List: 1→3→4→7
k: 2
Answer: 3
Testing
Input Format
The first line contains ‘T’ denoting the number of independent test cases.

For each test case the input has three lines:

A number ‘n’, denoting the length of the linked list.
n space-separated integers denoting elements of the linked list.
k denoting the position
Output Format
For each test case, the output has one line with space-separated integers.
